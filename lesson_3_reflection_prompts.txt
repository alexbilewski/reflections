When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you work on a project in a group, especially not locally based. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

.
	Someone might push new code that you didnt review yet or are working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are made specifically on Github servers. Clones and branches can be done both locally  and remotly on github. 
	Forks additionaly maintain relationtip with o original repository by stating information about the fork in original repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	It allows to compere our state to otheres. Plus it allow to work on it while keeping the original files in safe place. 
	
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? 
	When you start working on new feture or making experimental changes and want to be sure they will not affect the master code.
What benefits does each approach have?
	working in branches gives more flexibility in terms of safety and trying to puish code in new directions by multiple users,
	Working using just master branch is much easier but with limited colaborationn and safety (in terms of buck up).
